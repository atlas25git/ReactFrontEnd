Var vs Let
----------
Main difference is scoping rules. Variables declared by var keyword are scoped to the immediate function body 
(hence the function scope) while let variables are scoped to the immediate enclosing block denoted by { } 
(hence the block scope).

Arrow Fn
--------
const varName = (n) => {console.log(n)}
varName(n);

Normal
------
function print(arg){console.log()};

Exports Imports
---------------
When exported default then any name could be used, but if they aren't any default 
then we better use named imports.

In Js
-----
Class constructors are mentioned by the exact name. constructor(){}.
Inheritance using extends keyword, super() should be called in child's constructor.

Spread && Rest
--------------
'...' spreads up array or object.
Used in functions for multiple inputs, as it commbines them into an array/\.

Destructuring
-------------
{propName} = {object values}
