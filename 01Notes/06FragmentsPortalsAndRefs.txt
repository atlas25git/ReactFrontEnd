JSX Limitations:
----------------
1. We cannot return more than one jsx element from a component.
2. Using a file to wrap elements which would just return props.children, and thus have no divs.
    const wrapper = (props) => {
        return props.children;
    }
    same as <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
            <></>


Portal:
-------
1. Modals are deeply nested rather being an overlay.
2. Structurally this is incorrect.
3. For this we use portals, thus this enables us to use overlays, with right strcture.
4. Modal thus enables it implicitly be placed as an overlay.
5. Place to port, this is added in index.html probably above the root div.
6. Now we tell modal component where to port to.
7. We use react-dom to port them to the defined route.
8. ReactDOM.createPortal(<Backdrop onClick={props.onConfirm}/> ,document.getElementByID('backdrop-root') )
    similarly we add other overlays as well. 

References:
-----------
1. We can connect any html element with References, ref = {definedRefName}, definedRefName will now have the given value.
2. NOw we can avert the use of multiple listener and input states for each target and also it's value parameter, 
   which we used to clear the input field.
3. Now instead of listening to each key stoke we can just now use reference to store the value when the form is submitted.
4. For this we create  ref using useRef(), now we tie to some html element, and thus the input value on submit button would be
    saved in this ref, and thus this could be used as refName.current.val;
5. Now for the resetting logic we can defineRef.current.val = '';
6. Ref are uncontrolled components.
