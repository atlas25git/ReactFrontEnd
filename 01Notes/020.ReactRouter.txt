Traditional: Multi pages apps:
------------------------------
1. Traditionally we used multiple html pages stored statically or generated dynamically on the go.
2. But this approach is not optimal as we lose all the states and stuff b/w pages, and have to rely on req res, cycles to re render states.
3. With react we root for the JS to change instances on the client side JS app, and thus make it way more reactive, than conventional
   html page fetches.
4. In react when building complex applications we usually do so using a SPA, thus just one html req, res.
5. Url changes are handled by the javaScript.

React Router:
-------------
1. npm install react-router-dom
PreReq: import and wrap root app component using BrowserRouter component.
2. Defining and using routes:
    a) Define a route, and when this url becomes active, the 
        mapped component is rendered.
    b) Demonstration:
    import router
    import someCompoent

    <Route path="/someComponent">
        <someCompoent/>
    </Route>

    c) Now on the given path our defined component will be loaded.
