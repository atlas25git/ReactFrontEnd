There are 2 types of approaches for auth:
    1) Server side session-> 
        Traditional, 
        Identifier for the access given client stored with server.
        Sent back to client, and server maps the identifiers with it.
        Works great with tightly coupled application.
        Which is both front end and backend are served by the same server.
        But if one is served on server A, and the other on B then it's not of much use.
        Thus the server is stateless in decoupled systems.

    2) Authentication token
        Send Email pass-> validated ->?yes -> permissionToken generated has a key, which is only known to server.
        Client just has the hashed permission token, but it's private key is stored with server.
