Forms:
------
1. Vagaries in states cause it to seem way too complex.
2. Three sides of validation:
    A) onSubmit
    B) loseFocus
    C) onKeyStroke
3) preventDefault : so as to not send the req http to server.
4) userTouched state is set true in form submit fn.

Lost focus
-----------
1) Just like onChange onBlur is also a built in event handler.
2) We'll make a custom fn thus to handle the event when it is trigerred.
