1. ReactDom & React are quite insular with each other.
2. React uses virtual dom, and ReactDom helps with materializing the dom image to 
    make it real.
3. Virtual comparisons are done.
4. Only the diff in virtual doms are reflectd, in this case being react components they are re rendered.
5. The point here is that entire component is re run but in th real dom only the changes are reflectd, specifically
    the component where state/props/context are managed.
